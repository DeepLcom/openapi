    The text-translation API currently consists of a single endpoint, `translate`, which is described below.

    To learn more about context in DeepL API translations, we recommend [this article](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/general/working-with-context).
- name: TranslateDocuments
  description: |-
    The document translation API allows you to translate whole documents and supports the following file types and extensions:
      * `docx` - Microsoft Word Document
      * `pptx` - Microsoft PowerPoint Document
      * `xlsx` - Microsoft Excel Document
      * `pdf` - Portable Document Format
      * `htm / html` - HTML Document
      * `txt` - Plain Text Document
      * `xlf / xliff` - XLIFF Document, version 2.1
      * `srt` - SRT Document

    Please note that with every submitted document of type .pptx, .docx, .xlsx, or .pdf,
    you are billed a minimum of 50,000 characters with the DeepL API plan,
    no matter how many characters are included in the document.


    Translating a document usually involves three types of HTTP requests:
      - [upload](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/documents/translate-document) the document to be translated,
      - periodically [check the status](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/documents/get-document-status) of the document translation,
      - once the status call reports `done`, [download](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/documents/download-document) the translated document.

- name: RephraseText

    The `rephrase` endpoint  is used to make corrections and adjustments to texts based on style or tone.

- name: ManageMultilingualGlossaries
  description: |-
    The *glossary* functions allow you to create, inspect, edit and delete glossaries.
    Glossaries created with the glossary function can be used in translate requests by specifying the
    `glossary_id` parameter. A glossary contains (several) dictionaries.
    A dictionary is a mapping of source phrases to target phrases for a single language pair.
    If you encounter issues, please let us know at support@DeepL.com.

    Currently you can create glossaries with any of the languages DeepL supports.

    The maximum size limit for a glossary is 10 MiB = 10485760 bytes and each source/target text,
    as well as the name of the glossary, is limited to 1024 UTF-8 bytes.
    A total of 1000 glossaries are allowed per account.

    When creating a dictionary with target language `EN`, `PT`, or `ZH`, it's not necessary to specify a variant
    (e.g. `EN-US`, `EN-GB`, `PT-PT`, `PT-BR`, or `ZH-HANS`).
    Dictionaries with target language `EN` can be used in translations with either English variant.
    Similarly `PT`, and `ZH` dictionaries can be used in translations with their corresponding variants.
    (When you provide the ID of a glossary to a translation, the appropriate dictionary is automatically applied. Currently glossaries can not yet be used with source language detection.)

    Glossaries created via the DeepL API are now unified with glossaries created via the DeepL website and DeepL apps.
    Please only use the v3 glossary API in conjunction with multilingual or edited glossaries from the website.

    Please note that this is the spec for the (old) v2 glossary endpoint.
    We recommend users switch to the newer v3 glossary endpoints, which support editability and multilinguality.

    The *glossary* functions allow you to create, inspect, and delete glossaries.
    Glossaries created with the glossary function can be used in translate requests by specifying the
    `glossary_id` parameter.
    If you encounter issues, please let us know at support@DeepL.com.

    Glossaries with target language `EN` can be used in translations with either English variant.
    Similarly `PT`, and `ZH` glossaries can be used in translations with their corresponding variants.

    Note that on the v2 API, glossaries are immutable: once created, the glossary entries for a given glossary ID cannot be modified.

    As a workaround for effectively editable glossaries, we suggest to identify glossaries by name instead of ID in your application
    and then use the following procedure for modifications:
    - [download](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/glossaries/get-glossary-entries) and store the current glossary's entries,
    - locally modify the glossary entries,
    - [delete](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/glossaries/delete-glossary) the existing glossary,
    - [create a new glossary](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/glossaries/create-glossary) with the same name.

        This call uploads a document and queues it for translation.
        The call returns once the upload is complete, returning a document ID and key which can be used to
        [query the translation status](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/documents/get-document-status)
        and to [download the translated document](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/documents/download-document) once translation is complete.



        Because the request includes a file upload, it must be an HTTP POST request with content type `multipart/form-data`.


        Please be aware that the uploaded document is automatically removed from the server once the translated document has been downloaded.
        You have to upload the document again in order to restart the translation.


        The maximum upload limit for documents is [available here](https://support.deepl.com/hc/articles/360020582359-Document-formats)
        and may vary based on API plan and document type.


        You may specify the glossary to use for the document translation using the `glossary_id` parameter.
        **Important:** This requires the `source_lang` parameter to be set and the language pair of the glossary has to match the language pair of the request.

        Retrieve usage information within the current billing period together with the corresponding account limits. Usage is returned for:
        - translated characters
        - translated documents
        - translated documents, team totals (for team accounts only)

        Character usage includes both text and document translations, and is measured by the source text length in Unicode code points,
        so for example "A", "Δ", "あ", and "深" are each counted as a single character.

        Document usage only includes document translations, and is measured in individual documents.

        Depending on the user account type, some usage types will be omitted.
        Character usage is only included for developer accounts.
        Document usage is only included for non-developer accounts, and team-combined document usage is only included for non-developer team accounts.

    Context:
      description: |-
        The `context` parameter makes it possible to include additional context that can influence a translation but is not translated itself. 
        This additional context can potentially improve translation quality when translating short, low-context source texts such 
        as product names on an e-commerce website, article headlines on a news website, or UI elements.


        For example...
          - When translating a product name, you might pass the product description as context. 
          - When translating a news article headline, you might pass the first few sentences or a summary of the article as context.


        For best results, we recommend sending a few complete sentences of context in the same language as the source text. 
        There is no size limit for the `context` parameter itself, but the request body size limit of 128 KiB still applies to 
        all text translation requests. 


        If you send a request with multiple `text` parameters, the `context` parameter will be applied to each one. 


        Characters included in the `context` parameter will not be counted toward billing (i.e. there is no additional 
        cost for using the `context` parameter, and only characters sent in the text parameter(s) will be counted toward 
        billing for text translation even when the `context` parameter is included in a request).

        Specifies which DeepL model should be used for translation.

        Possible values are:
        * `latency_optimized` (default) - uses lower latency “classic” translation models, which support all language pairs;
          default value
        * `quality_optimized` - uses higher latency, improved quality “next-gen” translation models, which support only a
          subset of language pairs; if a language pair that is not supported by next-gen models is included in the
          request, it will fail. Consider using prefer_quality_optimized instead.
        * `prefer_quality_optimized` - prioritizes use of higher latency, improved quality “next-gen” translation models,
          which support only a subset of DeepL languages; if a request includes a language pair not supported by
          next-gen models, the request will fall back to latency_optimized classic models.

    OutlineDetectionOption:
      description: |-
        The automatic detection of the XML structure won't yield best results in all XML files. You can disable this automatic mechanism altogether by setting the `outline_detection` parameter to `false` and selecting the tags that should be considered structure tags. This will split sentences using the `splitting_tags` parameter.


        In the example below, we achieve the same results as the automatic engine by disabling automatic detection with `outline_detection=0` and setting the parameters manually to `tag_handling=xml`, `split_sentences=nonewlines`,  and `splitting_tags=par,title`.
         * Example request:
           ```
           <document>

               <par>This is the first sentence. Followed by a second one.</par>
               <par>This is the third sentence.</par>

        Sets whether the translation engine should first split the input into sentences. For text translations where 
        `tag_handling` is not set to `html`, the default value is `1`, meaning the engine splits on punctuation and on newlines.

        For text translations where `tag_handling=html`, the default value is `nonewlines`, meaning the engine splits on punctuation only, ignoring newlines.  

        The use of `nonewlines` as the default value for text translations where `tag_handling=html` is new behavior that was implemented in November 2022, 
        when HTML handling was moved out of beta. 

        Possible values are: 

         * `0` - no splitting at all, whole input is treated as one sentence
         * `1` (default when `tag_handling` is not set to `html`) - splits on punctuation and on newlines
         * `nonewlines` (default when `tag_handling=html`) - splits on punctuation only, ignoring newlines

        For applications that send one sentence per text parameter, we recommend setting `split_sentences` to `0`, in order to prevent the engine from splitting the sentence unintentionally.


        Please note that newlines will split sentences when `split_sentences=1`. We recommend cleaning files so they don't contain breaking sentences or setting the parameter `split_sentences` to `nonewlines`.

      description: |-
        Comma-separated list of XML tags which never split sentences.


        For some XML files, finding tags with textual content and splitting sentences using those tags won't yield the best results. The following example shows the engine splitting sentences on `par` tags and proceeding to translate the parts separately, resulting in an incorrect translation:
         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, es sei eine gute Idee gewesen.</par><par> Durchführung einer internen Untersuchung.</par>
        ```


        As this can lead to bad translations, this type of structure should either be avoided, or the `non_splitting_tags` parameter should be set. The following example shows the same call, with the parameter set to `par`:
         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, dass sie</par><par> eine interne Untersuchung durchgeführt</par><par> habe</par><par>.</par>
        ```


        This time, the sentence is translated as a whole. The XML tags are now considered markup and copied into the translated sentence. As the translation of the words "had been" has moved to another position in the German sentence, the two par tags are duplicated (which is expected here).

         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, es sei eine gute Idee gewesen.</par><par> Durchführung einer internen Untersuchung.</par>
        ```


        As this can lead to bad translations, this type of structure should either be avoided, or the `non_splitting_tags` parameter should be set. The following example shows the same call, with the parameter set to `par`:
         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, dass sie</par><par> eine interne Untersuchung durchgeführt</par><par> habe</par><par>.</par>
        ```


        This time, the sentence is translated as a whole. The XML tags are now considered markup and copied into the translated sentence. As the translation of the words "had been" has moved to another position in the German sentence, the two par tags are duplicated (which is expected here).
